  **Type** Weapon


  **Parts** There are no requirements; you can use any parts.


  **Effect** Sometimes you just can’t find enough parts of the same type to
  properly imbue your weapon, but you still want to imbue it with something.
  From that desperation and the haphazard imbuing of wildly different parts, a
  wild imbued property is born, inconsistent and lacking a few of the benefits
  of other imbued properties.

  **Path** Might

  - **4th** Strikes with the weapon deal 1 additional damage. Each time you deal
  damage, roll 1d6: On a 1, the weapon deals acid damage. On a 2, it deals cold
  damage. On a 3, it deals electricity damage. On a 4, it deals fire damage. On
  a 5, it deals negative damage. Finally, on a 6, it deals sonic damage

  - **6th** The additional damage increases to 1d4

  - **8th** The additional damage increases to 1d6

  - **12th** The damage dealt by this imbued property ignores resistances

  - **18th** The additional damage increases to 1d8

  - **20th** On a successful Strike with the weapon, before applying the
  additional damage, the target gains weakness 1 to that damage type until the
  beginning of your next turn
