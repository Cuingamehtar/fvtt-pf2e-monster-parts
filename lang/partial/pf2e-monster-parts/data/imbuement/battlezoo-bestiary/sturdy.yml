  **Type** Shield
  

  **Parts** The monster must have Hardness, resistance to physical damage, or
  resistance to one of the three physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing,
  or slashing damage). In some cases, you and the GM might decide together that
  a monster with resistance to physical damage because it is amorphous or
  gaseous doesn't provide appropriate parts.

  **Effect** You imbue the shield to make it even hardier than other shields. A
  shield with a _sturdy_ imbued property is hardier than other shields. As long as
  this imbued property's level is equal to the item level of the shield it
  imbues, increase the shield's Hardness by 3; for each level the imbued
  property is below the shield's item level, reduce this increased Hardness by
  1, to a minimum of 0 if the imbued property is 3 or more levels lower than the
  shield's item level. If this increases the shield's Hardness by at least 1,
  additionally increase the shield's Hit Points by 2 per Hardness, and the
  shield's Broken Threshold by 1 per Hardness.
flavor: You imbue the shield to make it even hardier than other shields.

no-effect: >-
  The difference between this imbuement level and the item level is too great.
