  **Type** Armor
  

  **Parts** The monster must have resistance or immunity to {damage} damage.

  **Effect** You imbue the armor to protect yourself from a particular
  type of energy. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance to {damage} damage equal to this imbued
  property's imbuing level. Additionally, the armor itself gains the
  same resistance. You can imbue a suit of armor with this property multiple times,
  though each time you do, you must choose a different type of energy damage,
  and each one counts separately against the armor's imbuing limit.

  **Type** Shield
  

  **Parts** The monster must have resistance or immunity to {damage} damage.

  **Effect** You imbue the shield to protect yourself from a particular
  type of energy. While wielding the shield, you gain resistance to {damage} damage 
  equal to this imbued property's imbuing level. Additionally, the shield itself 
  gains the same resistance. You can use Shield Block any time you would take 
  the chosen damage type, in addition to its usual trigger. For example, suppose
  you had a 12th level shield with 11 Hardness, granting you 12 fire resistance.
  If you took 40 damage from a fireball, you'd reduce the damage to 28 from 
  the fire resistance. If you then used Shield Bock, you would take 17 fire 
  damage, and your shield, which had 12 fire resistance of its own, would take
  only 5 fire damage.

  While wearing the armor, you gain resistance {level} to the chosen energy
  damage type. Additionally, the armor itself gains the same resistance.
shield-effect: >-
  While wielding the shield, you gain resistance {level} to the chosen energy
  damage type. Additionally, the shield itself gains the same resistance
  (applied after you reduce the damage by the shield's Hardness). You can use
  Shield Block any time you would take the chosen damage type, in addition to
  its usual trigger.
