  ability modifier.

  - - -

  **Effect** You imbue the item with sagacious _wisdom_.

  - **8th** The item can cast _augury_ once per day as a divine spell, as you
  wisely deduce the future through your own instincts rather than an external
  source

  - **14th** The item's _augury_ only takes you a single action activation to
  cast

  - **17th** When you invest the item, you either increase your Wisdom score by
  1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value. The item
  gains the apex trait

  of _augury_
